# Portfolio: Bootstrap

"Your portfolio is one of the most powerful tools in your software developer toolbox; it‚Äôs the easiest way of showing what you‚Äôre truly capable of as a developer, and is a quick and simple way for recruiters and hiring managers to get an idea of what you can bring to their teams." - Microverse

This project consists in building a copy of a portfolio template from scratch using Bootstrap, by choosing one of the [Microverse templates](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=1%3A1471) and sticking to that design (we chose Template 3).
